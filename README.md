Implement the following in C:1. Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits) and Hamming codegeneration.2. Write a program for distance vector algorithm to find suitable path for transmission.3. Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.4. Implement selective and repeat ARQ.SIMULATION EXERCISES1. Simulate a three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue sizeand vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.2. Simulate a four node point-to-point network with the links connected as follows:n0 – n2, n1 – n2 and n2 – n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP between n1-n3. Applyrelevant applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameter and determine the number ofpackets sent by TCP / UDP.3. Simulate the different types of Internet traffic such as FTP and TELNET over a network and analyzethe throughput.4. Simulate the transmission of ping messages over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and findthe number of packets dropped due to congestion.
